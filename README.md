# Linqua
## Vacabulary training tool

Whenever you learn a foreign language you usually write down new words/phrases that you need to learn and then come back and go through the list periodically until learned. Linqua is an app with a very simple and intuitive interface that allows you to do just that. Some of the additional features include:

Automatic translation to English when you add a word or phrase in a foreign language;
Go through your words in random order one by one;
Showing random words on a Live Tile on your phone's home screen (so you learn the words just by glancing at the live tile without having to open the app every time).
